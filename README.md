THE MAGNET HIGH SCHOOL GAME

In this game, you are placed into the body of a high school student who has made it into the Magnet High School Class of 2019

However, progressing through high school means the beginning of a lot of "tough" decisions...

You will be given 100 life points, and for every bad choice you make, you will lose points.

The worse the decision, the more points you lose.

If you happen to make the right choice, you will occasionally gain life points.

If your life reaches 0, you drop out of high school, live with your mother for the rest of your life, and die alone.

If you make it to the end of senior year alive, you win the game.
